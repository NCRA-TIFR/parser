18. Comments (During Observations) :

    09:56   Started a scan on 3c48 for 15 minutes.
    10:11   Stopped the scan.

	10:25   Started the command file
			/temp2/data/cmd/swarna/i060ab.cmd

    11:25   Source I06055 near to +260d azimuth(Outer limit). Stopped
            the command file started moving antennas to I06055 in
            inner track.

    11:49   Started the command file /temp2/data/cmd/swarna/i060ab.cmd
            in inner track.

    13:20   Scan 8 bad due to insufficient time between the two sources.

    14:35   Stopped the command file as sources in the file are transiting.
            Moved antennas to 3c147.

    14:50   Started a scan on 3c147.
    15:04   Stopped the scan.
            Antennas moved to source I06055.

    15:12   Started the command file  /temp2/data/cmd/swarna/i060ab.cmd.

    18:35   Stopped the command file, since source 0432 has been set.
            Antennas moved to source 3C147.

    18:39   Started the scan on 3C147.
    18:54   Stopped the scan.
            Closed the observation.
